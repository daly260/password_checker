# # Password Strength Checker

## 🔐 Overview
This is a simple yet professional **Password Strength Checker** built with **Python** and **Tkinter**. It provides real-time feedback on password strength based on essential security criteria.

## 🛠 Features
- **Live Password Evaluation**: The strength of the password is updated as you type.
- **Security Recommendations**: If the password is weak, suggestions are provided to improve it.
- **Color Indicators**:
  - 🔴 Weak: Password lacks required complexity.
  - 🟠 Medium: Password meets some requirements but could be stronger.
  - 🟢 Strong: Password is secure.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures password complexity based on character diversity.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Run the script in Python.
2. Enter a password in the input field.
3. The strength of your password will be displayed along with suggestions to improve it.
4. The checker evaluates based on:
   - Minimum **8 characters**
   - Must contain **uppercase and lowercase letters**
   - Must include **numbers**
   - Must have **special characters** (e.g., `!@#$%^&*`)

## 📌 Installation
1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Install Tkinter (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk   # For Debian/Ubuntu
   ```
3. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/password_checker/password_checker.git
   cd password_ checker
   ```
4. Run the script:
   ```sh
